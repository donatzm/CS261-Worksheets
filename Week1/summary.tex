I just finished my BS in Mathematics last term, and have been working at Boeing for the past two years as a structural test analyst.  While not explicitly part of my job description, I write python, matlab, and  VBA scripts to automate some analysis and make tools to help with the physical structural tests and data storage/manipulation. 

I don't have any formal computer science training (except for a cool class on computability theory a long time ago.) Getting this degree in CS will help with job prospects as well as giving me a formal introduction to CS.
